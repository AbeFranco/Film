    <h1>Licensing</h1>

    <h2>What Licensing Means</h2>
    <p>
      Licensing grants permission to use the film internally as a recurring resource.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Showing it to multiple groups</li>
      <li>Returning to it over time</li>
      <li>Building facilitated experiences around it</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      There are no subscriptions.<br/>
      No portals.<br/>
      No usage tracking systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      This mirrors how schools and organizations already operate.
    </p>

    <h2>How Licensing Is Enforced</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Clear license language</li>
      <li>Clear invoice descriptions</li>
      <li>Institutional good faith</li>
    </ul>

    <p>No DRM. No policing.</p>

    <h2>Pricing</h2>
    <p class="pricing-intro">
  Licensing options are built around how your organization plans to use the film — increasing flexibility and internal reuse as you move up tiers.

    <h2>Rights & Where You Can Show the Film</h2>

    </p>
    <p>
      Public performance, public online streaming, or public social media distribution is <strong>not</strong> included unless a separate agreement is made.
