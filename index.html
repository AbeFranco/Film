    <h1>A Short Story Designed for Meaningful Group Conversations</h1>
    <p class="subhead">
      I create short documentary films that schools and organizations license as
      repeatable internal resources for discussion, reflection, and facilitated experiences.

    <h2>What This Is</h2>
    <p>I don’t sell video content.</p>
    <p>
      I sell permission — permission to use a short, emotionally grounded story
      again and again inside your organization without reinventing the conversation every time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each film is intentionally brief (2–3 minutes).
      It earns attention quickly, then steps out of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The film is the spark.<br/>
      The curriculum helps facilitators use the moment well.

    <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>School districts and individual schools</li>
      <li>Chambers of commerce and civic groups</li>
      <li>Nonprofits, churches, and community organizations</li>
      <li>Businesses running retreats, onboarding, or leadership conversations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If your role involves getting people aligned, reflective, or engaged
      in a limited window of time, this is built for your setting.

    <h2>Why Licensing Exists</h2>
    <p>These films aren’t designed to be watched once and forgotten.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reused across cohorts</li>
      <li>Shared internally without friction</li>
      <li>Returned to when the conversation matters again</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Licensing makes that permission clear.</p>
