    <h2>What This Is</h2>
    <p>I don’t sell video content.</p>
    <p>
      I license agreements to use a short, emotionally grounded story
      again and again inside your organization without reinventing the conversation every time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each film is intentionally brief (2–3 minutes).
      It earns attention quickly, then steps out of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The film is the spark.<br/>
      The curriculum helps facilitators use the moment well.

    <h2>Why Licensing Exists</h2>
    <p>These films aren’t designed to be watched once and forgotten.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reused across cohorts</li>
      <li>Shared internally without friction</li>
      <li>Returned to when the conversation matters again</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Licensing makes that permission clear.</p>
